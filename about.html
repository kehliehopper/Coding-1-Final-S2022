    <h1>About Kehlie Hopper</h1>
      <h2>Hello! My name is Kehlie Hopper! I was born on May 12th in Jackson, Tennessee. While I was born in Jackson, I have not lived here my whole life.
          After I was born, my family and I moved to Arizona for a while and then into Texas. I came back to Jackson when I was in middle school. I currently
          go to Madison Academic Magnent High School, and I plan on majoring in international studies at Baylor University in the fall of 2023. I am the youngest of
          nine siblings! On top of my siblings, I have six pets; two dogs, two chickens, and two ducks. I have a very strong passion for helping others and making 
          this world a better place. I plan to go into diplomatic law after I graduate college. I've found that going into this profession will likely have the 
          biggest impact possible of this world.
